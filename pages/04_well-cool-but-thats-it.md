# Of course not

- Google supports tracking events for dem user insights
- We can have companion ads around the video, for mooar ad real estate
- ... but Google IMA SDK does a lot behind the scenes already, like 
    - _Active view measurement_ to track how much of an ad has been viewed (if the video player supports skippable ads)
    - integrates with the Open Measurement Interface definition for ad performance tracking of third-parties
    - ...

    - of course depending on the scenario

- And surely there are solutions out there that help with ads
    - [video.js](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/)
    - [media-chrome](https://www.media-chrome.org/)
    - and nice themes (and or inspiration) [ref](https://player.style/)
    - ... these are all done by _mux_
